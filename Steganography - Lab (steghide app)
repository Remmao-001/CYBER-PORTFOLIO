# Steganographry - Lab (steghide app)

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Steganography Analysis and Obfuscation project focused on the practical application of the steghide utility for hiding text within image files. The primary objective was to understand, use, and document the process of embedding a secret message into a cover image and subsequently extracting it using a known passphrase. This hands-on exercise demonstrated a fundamental technique used in digital forensics and covert communication.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using the steghide command-line utility for both embedding and extracting data.
- Understanding of steganography concepts, specifically, how to hide a file within a non suspicious carrier file(image).
- Ability to read and interpret manual pages to find command flags and options
- Familiarity with basic Linux file operations for creating, vieweing, and managing files
- Knowledge of key flag options and their roles in the steganography process.
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Linux 
- steghide (steganography application)
- nano (Command-line text editor for creating the secret message file)
- cat (Linux command for displaying file contents)
- rm (Linux command for removing files)
